# My-useless-discord-bots
Here go my useless discord bots, they don't do much i mostly made them for fun when trying to figure out what you can do with a discord bot

I 99% sure I hid the token
I have honestly no idea what to put in a readme

# B-day bot
The b-day bot uses SQLite3, MySQL can also be used

The add command allows a user to add to the database, the database uses the userID and the serverID to make it so that when adding a birthday a user can only add their birthday on the server they added to they would need to add again in another server

The update command allows a user to change their birthday in the database

The display command shows all of the birthdays of users that have but their birthdays for that discord server, it displays their server nicknames followed by their birthday
